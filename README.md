# Overview
   Storybook allows you to input the text from children’s story in
   a different language, to your 
    native language, and then dynamically build a VR environment based of the story’s own environment.
    It puts you in a whole new foreign world!
	
  Along with this dynamic VR environment, as the story builds objects are labeled in the story’s 
  native language as the story is read aloud in your language. This will encourage a better comprehension 
  of the new language while the user participates in the story. All together, Storybook is a fun 
  VR application that has educational value tied with it.
  
# Demo
This is the VR environment for the story "Little Red Riding Hood" that was translated from a Spanish script into an English Script, then read aloud in English.
